A Quadratic Equation is an equation in the form ax2+bx+c where a and b are co-efficients of x2 and x respectively.

In order to obtain the roots (i.e the solution) of the equation, we use the formula x = (−b ± √(b2 − 4ac)) / 2a. Other methods such as Factorization and Completing the Square can also be used.

Enter the coefficients a and b and constant c to get the roots of your equation: Note that all calculations are done to 1 decimal place.

If the roots of the equation you provided cannot be determined, the app will return NaN(Not A Number). This happens if the expression (√b2-4ac) returns a negative number. Recall that we cannot determine the square root of a negative number.
